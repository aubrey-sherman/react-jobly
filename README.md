## Jobly

Jobly is a React front-end app for job searching.

Users can:
* sign up
* log in/out
* view lists of companies and individual company cards
* search for specific companies and jobs

It connects with an Express back-end API that handles user authorization and serving information from the database. Repo for the back-end can be found [here](https://github.com/aubrey-sherman/jobly-be).
